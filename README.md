# pixel re-arranger
Small python code made for rearranging the pixels in an image in order to recreate another image.

The purpose is to exemplificate how a Multilayer Perceptron sees "in the same way" two images, because they have the same pixels. And the dinstiction is easy once one take care of pixels near pixels (CNN's).

The arrangement is made channel by channel!!!
This means that by the same pixels, we mean the same total numbers channel by channel (independently), we can come up with new colors. Also there's a way of making it with the exact color pixels, but the results still not great.
